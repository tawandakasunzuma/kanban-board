## 📖 Code Structure & Quality

This project follows a **modular structure**:

- `main.js`: Entry point; initializes the app, fetches tasks from the API, and begins rendering
- `api.js`: Handles all data fetching from the Kanban API
- `render.js`: Contains DOM manipulation logic to render and update tasks on the page
- `modal.js`: Manages task-create/edit modals (opening, closing, and form buttons logic)
- `storage.js`: Interacts with `localStorage` to load and persist tasks
- `sidebar.js`: Controls sidebar show/hide behavior for responsive navigation
- `theme.js`: Implements light/dark theme toggle and persists the user’s preference

All modules are cleanly separated and well-documented:
Functions are documented using **JSDoc** for clarity and maintainability.
